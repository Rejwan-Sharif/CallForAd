Advertising Management System

The Advertising Management System is a comprehensive web application that combines Spring Boot for the backend and Angular for the front end. The project's main goal is to simplify the process of managing and promoting advertisements and catering to vendors, regular users, and administrators.

Key Features:

User Roles: The application supports two types of users - vendors and regular users. Vendors have the ability to create, edit, and delete advertisements for available spaces, such as billboards. They can also opt to promote their ads by making payments.

Advertisement Posting: Vendors can provide detailed information about the available spaces and post advertisements. These ads can be promoted to gain priority placement on the homepage and other prominent sections of the application.

User Engagement: Interested users can interact with advertisements by sending quotations to the vendors. This direct communication channel fosters potential business collaborations.

Newspaper Ad Requests: Users can submit requests for newspaper advertisements through the system, streamlining the process of getting ads published in newspapers.

Admin Control: The admin panel plays a crucial role in the system's operation. Administrators review and approve vendor-submitted posts and payment information. Once approved, the ads are displayed on the webpage. Admins also manage newspaper ads, and user accounts, and have access to insightful charts and summaries for monitoring system performance.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Spring Boot, MySQL, JDBC, Jasper Reports, JWT Authentication.
